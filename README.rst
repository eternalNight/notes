Klee Analysis
=============

This is a repo for maintaining my personal analysis notes on Klee [1]_, a symbolic virtual machine.

Goals
-----

* Reproduce the work in OSDI paper

* Analyze the uclibc environment in the implementation

* Replace uclibc with bionic libc so that Android libraries and applications can be checked
